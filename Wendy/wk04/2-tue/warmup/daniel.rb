#Daniel
#Daniel is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

#He answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question. He answers 'Whatever.'
#if you tell him something. He answers 'Woah, chill out!'
#if you yell at him (ALL CAPS). He says 'Fine. Be that way!'
#if you address him without actually saying anything.

#Write code in ruby so that you can have an interactive conversation with Daniel.
#Make sure you include some testing in order to verify your code.

#Hints
#gets, get string is the opposite of puts put string.

#Notice that when you type "Something" and then hit enter, you get the string "Something\n"

#loop do

#l33t sP34k

#Daniel, inspired by the 90s, is bringing back "l33t sP34k",
#and he'll teach you how to do it. Start any sentence with "Bro, ",
#and he'll translate the rest of it into l33t sP34k for you.

#In brief:
#Several vowels are always replaced with numbers: a = 4, e = 3, i = 1, o = 0
#Words that start with a consonant start with lower case
#Consonants after the first letter alternate upper and lower case, except the alternation starts over with lowercase after a digit (ex: sCh00l)

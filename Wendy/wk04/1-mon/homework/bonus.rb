#write a program in ruby that randomly organize a list of things into groups

#prompts the user for a list of things and store them inside an array
#prompts the user for a group size
#randomly assign things into groups with size given
#print out the groups in whatever way you like
#enter a list:
#bart,homer,lisa,maggie
#enter group size:
#2

#[['bart','lisa'],['maggie','homer']]
#if there are left overs with the given group size just assign them to the last group

#enter a list:
#bart,homer,lisa,maggie,ned
#enter group size:
#2

#[['bart','lisa'],['ned','homer','maggie']]
